# Advance-Python-UU-Darius

# This is Mohammad Baghban Shemirani, and I go by the name Darius.
# I am a battery chemist here at Ångström structural chemistry group.
# I will be using python to process my data that I get from different instruments and I want to be able to quickly and efficiently process and automate them.
# For example, we cycle the batteries with a constant current until we reach
# a certain cut-off potential. Based on this data and how we have programmed
# the cycling, we can get various plots such as capacity vs voltage and such.
# These are done in steps and the data files have a step column.
# Each time these data need to be plotted or analysed in a different way so
# making a batch process using python to analyse and select what info you
# want makes life easier.
# An example would be a method called intermitent current interuption, where
# you pause every few minutes for a second and you look at the voltage resp-
# -onse. In turn you can find the resistance by doing the mathematic
# operations.
